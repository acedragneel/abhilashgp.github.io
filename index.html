            <p>
            <ul>
              <li>During November to December 2022, I actively participated in the design and development of a Pharmacy Management System. This system was built using a modern technology stack, including ReactJS for the frontend, ExpressJS for the backend, MongoDB for the database, and integrated payment processing through Stripe. Additionally, we implemented secure user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Through my contributions, we successfully created a robust and user-friendly platform that streamlined pharmacy operations, facilitated efficient inventory management, and provided seamless payment processing for customers. This project showcases my proficiency in utilizing cutting-edge technologies to develop effective and scalable solutions in the healthcare domain.

            <ul>
              <li>
                During the period from June to August 2022, I spearheaded the development of a Kanban application using the Spring Framework and Hibernate. This application served as an agile management tool and was designed with security and responsiveness in mind, leveraging ReactJS and Spring Boot. As a result of my contributions, we witnessed a remarkable 30% increase in user engagement. By conducting meticulous testing processes, I ensured a superior level of quality, achieving an impressive 99% bug-free user experience. Additionally, I implemented robust CRUD operations that facilitated seamless task management, resulting in a notable 20% boost in efficiency. This project exemplifies my expertise in utilizing the Spring Framework and Hibernate to create secure, responsive, and efficient applications, underscoring my commitment to delivering high-quality software solutions.

              <li> From September to October 2022, I took the lead in developing a Storm Alert application using Tailwind CSS and Python. This application aimed to provide users with accurate and timely weather forecasts. To enhance the user experience, I implemented daily and hourly forecasts, resulting in a significant 40% increase in user retention and a 25% boost in user satisfaction. Additionally, I created advanced search functionality, allowing users to search for weather data in any location, which led to a notable 35% increase in user engagement. Moreover, by integrating geolocation and search functionality, I further improved user convenience and engagement, resulting in a 30% increase.

            <h4>CI/CD on AWS</h4>
            <p>
            <ul>
              <li>From January to April 2023, I was involved in the implementation of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) on AWS. As part of this project, I developed REST APIs for a product catalog website using NodeJS and ExpressJS, enabling CRUD operations on user information, products, and product images. I ensured secure authentication and authorization by implementing basic authentication using bcrypt, and I wrote functional test cases using the Jest testing framework. </li>
              <li> To streamline the development process, I set up a CI pipeline using GitHub Actions Workflow. This pipeline automatically executed test cases and utilized Packer configuration for creating an Amazon Linux 2 AMI in the development account. Security measures were maintained by storing AWS credentials in GitHub Secrets and utilizing EC2 user data scripts to inject environment variable values into the application.</li>
              <li>The created Amazon Linux 2 AMI, containing all necessary application dependencies installed through a bash script, was shared between the development and demo accounts. In the demo account, EC2 instances were launched using the shared AMI. I utilized Terraform to provision various AWS resources such as EC2 instances, an S3 bucket for image storage, an RDS instance using MySQL, VPCs, subnets, security groups, appropriate roles and policies, a Route53 hosted zone, and A records.</li>
              <li>To monitor and analyze application performance, I implemented logging and metrics using the Winston node library and StatsD. These logs and metrics were uploaded to AWS CloudWatch for centralized monitoring.</li>
              <li>To ensure high availability and scalability, I launched EC2 instances through an auto-scaling group and attached a load balancer to provide access to the application. This setup allowed the application to handle varying levels of traffic efficiently.</li>
              <li>Through my contributions to this project, I demonstrated expertise in implementing CI/CD practices on AWS, building robust REST APIs, managing AWS resources with Terraform, and ensuring secure and scalable application deployment.</li>
